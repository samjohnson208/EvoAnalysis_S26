Here's where I'll put info and usages for assignments.

## Challenge 3 - Counting .fastq reads using a slurm job array

Run this script to extract the number of reads from a collection of .fastq files, and to place ouptut from each .fastq into a .txt file that corresponds to the name of the .fastq.

``` 
sbatch EvoAnalysis_S26/slurms/challenge3.sh
```

See comments within the script for functionality, see outupt in:
